# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language
you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university
coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Getting Started

For the pre-commit hooks to work, you will need to install Husky.  An easy way to do that is to run `deno run -A npm:husky install`

## 2023

For 2023, I am solving the puzzles in [Deno](https://deno.com/). See my
[solutions](./2023/).
