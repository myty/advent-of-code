# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language
you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university
coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I'm using [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage my development environment.

## 2025

For 2025, I've decided to solve the puzzles in [Go](https://go.dev/). It's a language that I've been trying to learn and what a better way to learn a new language than to solve puzzles with it?

To run the puzzles, you can use the following command:

```sh
go run ./<day><number>
```

## 2024

For 2024, I've decided to solve the puzzles in [Deno](https://deno.com/) again
mostly because of this: <https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024>. You can
follow along with my (work-in-progress) [solutions for 2024](./2024/).

## 2023

For 2023, I am solving the puzzles in [Deno](https://deno.com/). See my
[solutions](./2023/). They may not be pretty, but they work.
